# Trying to 100% python

Project dedicated to:
- Recap stuff i have not used in a while
- Check if if i know everything about known subjects
- Learn the last bits I still need.

[Python developer roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/python)

Progress can be found in progress.ods

Note: [The official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.12/tutorial/index.html)
