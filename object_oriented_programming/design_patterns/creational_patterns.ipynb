    "\n",
    "Creational Design Patterns focus on the process of object creation or problems related to object creation. They help in making a system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented. Creational patterns give a lot of flexibility in what gets created, who creates it, and how it gets created.\n",

    "\n",
    "This pattern is typically helpful when it's necessary to separate the construction of an object from its implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the use of this design pattern, objects can be produced without having to define the exact class of object to be created."
