    "Creational Design Patterns focus on the process of object creation or problems related to object creation. They help in making a system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented. Creational patterns give a lot of flexibility in what gets created, who creates it, and how it gets created.\n",

    "Provides a step-by-step approach to constructing complex objects. It separates the construction process from the object’s representation, enabling the same method to create different variations of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use the Builder Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "- When constructing an object is complex and involves many optional steps.\n",
    "- When you want to separate construction logic from representation.\n",
    "- When you want to avoid telescoping constructors (constructors with too many parameters).\n",
    "- When different representations (e.g., gaming computer, office computer) can be built using the same construction process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components of the Builder Design Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Product**: The Product is the complex object that the Builder pattern is responsible for constructing.\n",
    "- **Builder**: An interface/abstract class that defines steps for building parts of the product.\n",
    "- **ConcreteBuilder**: Implements the Builder interface with specific logic to build a variation of the product.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Steps to implement the Builder Design Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create the Product Class**: Define the object (product) that will be built. This class contains all the fields that make up the object.\n",
    "2. **Create the Builder Class**: This class will have methods to set the different parts of the product. Each method returns the builder itself to allow method chaining.\n",
    "3. **Add a Build Method**: In the builder class, add a method called build() (or similar) that assembles the product and returns the final object.\n",
    "4. **Use the Director (Optional**): If needed, you can create a director class to control the building process and decide the order in which parts are constructed.\n",
    "5. **Client Uses the Builder**: The client will use the builder to set the desired parts step by step and call the build() method to get the final product.\n"
